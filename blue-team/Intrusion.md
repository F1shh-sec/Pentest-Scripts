The running theme for this page is FOSS. I am a broke college student and my tooling definitely reflects that. Regardless, these are all amazing tools.
## OSSEC (Open Source Security)
[OSSEC](https://www.ossec.net/) is a free and open [source](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids) endpoint security monitoring. This is the building block for a lot of open source security solutions such as Wazuh. There are few good reasons not to use OSSEC for endpoint management. Its one of the best FOSS HIDs.  OSSEC has great support for the following features:
- Real time alerts
- Multi-platform agents
- Log monitoring
- rootkit detection
- active response
- file integrity checks
- centralized management

## Wazuh
[Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/install/) is an Free and Open [Source](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/) Security Information and Event Management and Extended Detection and Response software that leverages the Open Source Security Host based Intrusion Detection Software for endpoint security. Or for short, its a ***FOSS SIEM XDR using the [OSSEC](https://www.ossec.net/) HIDS***. 

**Download and install the manager manager:**
```bash

## Snort 
[Snort](https://www.snort.org/) is a Free and Open [Source](https://github.com/snort3/snort3) Network based Intrusion Prevention system. This tool is amazing at sniffing packets and digesting logs. The tool is maintained by the Cisco Talos and the snort engine pairs well with the ELK stack.
