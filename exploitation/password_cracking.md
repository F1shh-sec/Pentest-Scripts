## Building words lists
Use content from webpages to build a dictionary. This can include company pages, Facebook, twitter, and any other resource gathered when doing OSINT on the target. To grab all words from a page, Use Cewl.

**Password Manglers:**
- [RSMangler](https://github.com/digininja/RSMangler)
- [Crunch](https://sourceforge.net/projects/crunch-wordlist/)
- [pydictor](https://github.com/LandGrey/pydictor)

**Building Wordlists:**
```bash
# Grab words form a site
cewl https://example.com -v --with-numbers -w words.txt

# Password Mangeling, High storage cost for longer lists.
python pydictor.py -extend words.txt --leet 0 1 2 11 21 --level 1 --len 4 16 --occur "<=10" ">0" "<=2" -o /possbile/wordlist.lst

# This will create a multiple GB file. You dont have the storage. 
./rsmangler.rb words.txt -yieulcp
```


## Brute forcing tools
- Burpsuite (intruder): [https://portswigger.net/burp](https://portswigger.net/burp)
- Hydra: [https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra)

**Hydra:**
```bash
hydra -l <username> -P <LIST> <ip> <Protocol>
```

when bruteforcing SSH, you need to specify a timing interval:
```bash
hydra -l <username> -P <LIST> <ip> ssh -t4
```

**John to crack windows hashdump:**
```bash
john --format=NT <hashes.txt> --wordlist=<wordlist.txt>
john --show --fromat=LM <hashfile.txt>
```

**John to crack /etc/shadow**
```bash
# Create a txt file for /etc/passwd and shadow
cp /etc/passwd passwd.txt
cp /etc/shadow shadow.txt

# Unshadow 
unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > unshadowed.txt

# Crack with john 
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt unshadowed.txt
```

## Protocols to target
**Protocols:** telnet, smtp, http, https, smb, rpc, rdp, pop, sql.

**Easy ports to hit:** 20-23, 25, 80, 443, 135, 139.

## General advice
- Specify speed when bruteforcing SSH or you will hit a wall quickly. Using hydra, this is done using the `T4` parameter.
- Stop after gaining access to one account. Try its creds on everything, and use its creds for further enumeration. **Never forget to try `sudo -i` for easy escalation.**
- Always take a look around the host machines file system when possible. potential low hanging fruit for enumeration. EX: Local user list at `/etc/passwd`.
- Never crack hashes on target machine. Speed and stealth will be abysmal.
