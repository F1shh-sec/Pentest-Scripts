## Building words lists
Use content from webpages to build a dictionary. This can include company pages, Facebook, twitter, and any other resource gathered when doing OSINT on the target. To grab all words from a page, Use Cewl.

**cewl:**
```sh
cewl https://example.com
```

## Brute forcing tools
- Burpsuite (intruder): https://portswigger.net/burp
- Hydra: https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra

**Hydra:**
```sh
hydra -u <username> -P <LIST> <ip> <Protocol>
```


## Protocols to target
**Protocols:** telnet, smtp, http, https, smb, rpc, rdp, pop, sql.

**Easy ports to hit:** 20-23, 25, 80, 443, 135, 139.

## General advice
- Specify speed when bruteforcing SSH or you will hit a wall quickly. Using hydra, this is done using the `T4` parameter.
- Stop after gaining access to one account. Try its creds on everything, and use its creds for further enumeration. **Never forget to try `sudo -i` for easy escalation.**
- Always take a look around the host machines file system when possible. potential low hanging fruit for enumeration. EX: Local user list at `/etc/passwd`.
- Never crack hashes on target machine. Speed and stealth will be abysmal.
