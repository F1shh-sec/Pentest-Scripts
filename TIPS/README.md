# Background Info
As I learn more and more about penetration-testing, I try and take as many notes as possible. I write down one liners, techniques, and tools that can help me accomplish a given goal. If I encounter the same problem again some time in the future, I am able to just open my book and find the solution.

I though it would be useful to the greater information security community if I digitized and shared my notes. Every once and a while, I'm going to type up a page or two from my notebook, and publish it here. 

# Formatting
As previously stated, This is a digitized version of my personal notes. That means they might not be 100% accurate, reputable, or repeatable. I am a human, and every once in a while humans copy things down incorrectly. I do not vouch for the safety or results of any of these tools. Use at your own risk.
