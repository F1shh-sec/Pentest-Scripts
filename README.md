# About
This book as a collection of useful commands and techniques that I find useful when penetration testing. Since this book is synced directly to my notebook, I can not vouch for everything being 100% accurate. sometimes I copy things down wrong, however I am doing my best to keep everything as accurate as possible.

# Web Bruteforcer
Script to bruteforce web credentials. Can take in cookie and header parameters. Can also be easily configured to make either a post or get request. Implements concurrency, so you may get rate limited when using this tool. You may want to go with a more robust tool such as Hydra or Burpsuite for more advanced bruteforcing
