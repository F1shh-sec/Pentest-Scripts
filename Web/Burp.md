Burpsuite is a **Man in the middle (MITM) web application proxy**. At a base level, Burp can be used to intercept and modify traffic sent by a web browser. Burpsuite can also be used for:
- Bypass client side input validation.
- Capture and log all HTTP requests made by the browser.
- Passively build a sitemap as you walk the application.
- Modify and replay previous requests.
- Decode/encode text
- Add/remove/modify Headers and parameters.
- Change request method
- Automate a sequence of requests (think authentication)
- Manage cookies and user sessions. 
- Perform a plethora of web based attacks.
- Prevent out of scope requests (this can and will save your ass at some point)
- **\[PRO]** Automatic Vulnerability scanner and validation
- **\[PRO]** Automatically spider website and build site map (similar to gobuster or dirb)
- **\[PRO]** Session persistence and saved projects. 

> The professional version has some automagic features, but this is still a *very* manual tool. You will still need to know how to find and exploit common vulnerabilities to take full advantage of this tool.
